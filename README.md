# K_means-clustering
K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group similar data points into clusters. It works by assigning points to the nearest centroid and updating centroids iteratively to minimize within-cluster variance. This project demonstrates clustering, optimal K selection using the Elbow Method.
